        Whenever a view is interacting with the other then it is done with the help of Behaviors. We create a particular behavior for a particular view and these behaviors are responsible for animations between the views. Some of the common Material Design behaviors are sliding drawers, swipe-dismissal, floating action button, a sticky button that stick on some other view. So, broadly these behaviors can be classified into two types:  Layout-Based: Layout-Based behaviors are used to shift one view to some other place when you perform a certain operation. For example, whenever you click on a Floating Action Button(FAB), then that FAB will be moved up and one Snackbar will come from the bottom of the screen. After a few seconds, the Snackbar will be gone and the FAB will come to its original place. Scroll-Based: Scroll-Based behaviors are the most common use of Coordinator Layout. Here, these behaviours are based on the scroll gesture of the user on the mobile screen. Remember the example of WhatsApp, that we discussed in the introduction section. When you scroll the profile or contact page in WhatsApp, then you will find that the profile image will be changed to ActionBar. So, these types of behaviors are called Scroll-Based behaviors.
